# Introduction {#sec-intro}

The course calendar description for PUB609 is as follows:

> Targeting recreational water quality, this course examines: public swimming pools, spas, bathing beaches, recreational camp waterfronts, and other recreational water facilities such as splash pads, wading pools and water parks. Biological, chemical and physical hazards are reviewed, including their impacts on health and safety. Relevant legislation, case studies, and guidelines are examined, with a focus on water quality assessment, control, and management.

The laboratory component of the course, which averages to 1 hour per week, will focus on practical applications and experiments of the content learned in the lectures. The laboratory modules will include a hybrid of in-lab sessions, online or digital sessions (to be completed remotely), and a self-guided field-based component.

## Laboratory Schedule

Due to the large class size and capacity limitations in the School lab, students have been divided into sections that will determine your laboratory schedule each week. Please refer to your RAMSS timetable for your section number and time. Refer to the course syllabus and D2L for due dates and other course information and announcements.

## Health and Safety in the Lab

Throughout the labs, you will be in contact with some corrosive chemicals and other possible hazards. Therefore, it is very important that you take proper precautions to protect yourself. Please refer to the most recent version of the university's [Laboratory Safety Manual](https://www.torontomu.ca/facilities-management-development/environmental-health-safety/laboratory-safety/) for details on lab health and safety measures.

Students must wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when working in the laboratory as per the following instructions:

-   Wear safety glasses and a lab coat at all times.
-   If you have long hair, tie it back.
-   Ensure your legs are completely covered and wear closed-toe shoes.
-   For some experiments, you will be required to wear safety gloves to protect yourself from skin exposure.

Some additional general advice and good working practices relevant to the labs in this course are summarized below:

-   Refrain from using personal devices such as cell phones in the lab, as they may affect your concentration, disturb others, or become contaminated.
-   **Never** dispose of hazardous chemicals down the sink.
-   **Never** perform a "sniff-test" of chemicals.
-   Keep your personal belongings outside the lab or in a designated area.
-   Do not bring food or beverages into the lab.
-   Keep your lab area clean and free of clutter, including regularly wiping down stations and cleaning spills immediately.
-   Keep chemical containers closed and in a safe location (e.g., away from the edge of the counter) when not in use.
-   Consult the lab supervisor if you have any questions or concerns, or wish to view chemical safety data sheets (SDS).
-   Report any accidents immediately to the lab instructor.

## Health and Safety in the Field

For the field-based portion of the lab, please adhere to the following safety precautions:

-   Be aware of your surroundings and wear proper footwear (e.g., running shoes or boots when collecting any samples to avoid slips or falls).
-   Be aware of recent and current weather conditions for travel to any sites.
-   When approaching any water bodies for sample collection, take safety precautions to avoid slipping or falling into the water.
